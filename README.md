# robotology-superbuild-dependencies

Windows binaries for the dependencies of robotology-superbuild .

The following libraries (and their dependencies) are built using `vcpkg`: 
* `ace`
* `asio`
* `boost-asio`
* `boost-process` 
* `boost-dll`
* `boost-filesystem`
* `boost-system` 
* `freeglut`
* `gsl`
* `eigen3`
* `ode`
* `libxml2`
* `eigen3` 
* `opencv` 
* `matio`
* `sdl1`
* `sdl2`
* `qt5-base[latest]`
* `qt5-declarative`
* `qt5-multimedia`
* `qt5-quickcontrols`
* `qt5-quickcontrols2`
* `sqlite3[core,tool]`

furthermore, the `ipopt-binary` and the `esdcan-binary` from [`robotology-vcpkg-binary-ports`](https://github.com/robotology-dependencies/robotology-vcpkg-binary-ports) is also installed.

The binaries are generated by installing vcpkg in `C:/robotology/vcpkg`, installing the selected ports, and compressing the `C:/robotology` directory in a `.zip` archive.

See [releases](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild-dependencies-vcpkg/releases) to download the archives.

## Usage 
To use the archive, you just need to donwload it and extract it in the `C:/` directory.

To use then vcpkg libraries, you need to configure your CMake projects to use the vcpkg's 
toolchain as `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`, for example by configuring the projects as:  
~~~
cmake -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/robotology/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ..
~~~
See [vcpkg's documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/users/integration.md#cmake-toolchain-file-recommended-for-open-source-cmake-projects)  for more info on how to use vcpkg-installed libraries.

### Install or remove ports 
You can install or remove  ports from the vcpkg installation in `C:/robotology/vcpkg` as you do for any other vcpkg installation.

However, as this  vcpkg installation contains some ports installed  from the custom port repo contained in `C:/robotology/vcpkg`, 
due to a regression in vcpkg (see https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/10119) you need to pass the `--overlay-ports=C:/robotology/vcpkg/robotology-vcpkg-binary-ports` argument whenever you use vcpkg.

For example, to install a new port called `<portname>` the correct command is:
~~~
./vcpkg.exe install --overlay-ports=C:/robotology/vcpkg/robotology-vcpkg-binary-ports <portname>:x64-windows
~~~


### GitHub Actions 
To use the script in a GitHub Action script, you can use the following snippet: 
~~~~
    - name: Dependencies [Windows]
      if: matrix.os == 'windows-latest'
      run: |
        # To avoid spending a huge time compiling vcpkg dependencies, we download an archive  
        # that comes precompiled with all the ports that we need 
        choco install -y wget unzip
        # To avoid problems with non-relocatable packages, we unzip the archive exactly in the same directory
        # that has been used to create the pre-compiled archive
        cd C:/
        wget https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild-dependencies-vcpkg/releases/download/<INSERT_HERE_THE_USED_VERSION>/vcpkg-robotology.zip
        unzip vcpkg-robotology.zip -d C:/
        rm vcpkg-robotology.zip
~~~~
